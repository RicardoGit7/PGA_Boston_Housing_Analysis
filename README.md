## Introduction

In this project, we analyze the Boston housing dataset to provide insights to upper management. The analysis includes generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and performing statistical tests to answer specific questions related to housing prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the U.S. Census Service and contains various features related to housing prices in Boston, such as crime rate, average number of rooms, age of buildings, and median home value.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into the following sections:
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualizations
- Statistical tests

## Results

The results of the analysis provide insights into:
- The significant difference in median values of houses bounded by the Charles River.
- The difference in median values of houses based on the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
- The correlation between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- The impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights for upper management to make informed decisions regarding housing policies, environmental regulations, and urban planning in Boston.
