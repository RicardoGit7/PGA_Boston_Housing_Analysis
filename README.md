# PGA_Boston_Housing_Analysis
In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing dataset to provide insights to upper management. 
The analysis includes generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and performing statistical tests to answer specific questions related to housing prices. 
This is my final assignment for the IBM course Statistics for Data Science with Python.
Hope you find it useful and informative.
